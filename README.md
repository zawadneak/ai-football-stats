# Football Stats Extraction using Yolo

### Running the project

Please get a video from the [Football Clips Used](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout/data?select=clips) section and paste it into the videos/ folder named as _play.mp4_

You will also need an API Key from the roboflow dataset.
